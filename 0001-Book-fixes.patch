             <p class="noindent">Does God exist?</p>
             <p class="noindent">Many people regard this question as almost ludicrously simple, and thus also as provocative and confrontational. But the problem is that major and polarising discord remains concerning the answer. Some say that the answer to this simple question obviously is a resounding no: Of course there is no God! All talk of a God is an expression of a tenaciously persistent superstition that has stuck with humanity throughout all of known history, ever since the rain dances of the first shamans. A superstition that in all likelihood will wither away and die as our knowledge of the nature of physics at the macro and micro levels grows sufficiently to be able to refute the many foolish notions of religion and document how these are tied to various sociocultural conditions.</p>
             <p class="noindent">But as we know, some others are as unshakeably convinced that God not only exists with the greatest certainty, but also that this God painstakingly keeps track of all of our sins as well as our good deeds. And as if that were not enough, this <a id="page_6"></a>same God created our planet and all its innumerable life forms at the dawn of Time. This God, who thus exists, permeates every aspect of our existence, and not believing in Him and admitting this is something that sooner or later will incur punishment. Possibly for all eternity. But the matter is complicated further by the lack of agreement among these many people who are convinced of His existence as to exactly which god really does exist, and throughout history this has given rise to innumerable conflicts &#8211; battles and wars that have claimed countless human lives in the name of God. So how could God <i>not</i> exist?</p>
-            <p class="noindent">So in fact, this seemingly simple question must be nuanced and made more specific, at least somewhat, in order for us to be able to discuss it in a meaningful way. What the answer will be &#8211; and what the question actually means &#8211; depends, of course, partly on what we mean by &#8220;God&#8221;, and partly on what we mean by &#8220;exist&#8221;. Let us start with the latter, which might perhaps be the most convenient place to start. A beautiful poem, untitled, one of the very last authored by the Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa &#8211; the manuscript is dated as November 19, 1935 &#8211; reads as follows:</p>
-            <p class="noindent1">There are sicknesses worse than any sickness;</p>
-            <p class="noindent1">There are pains that don&#8217;t ache, not even in the soul,</p>
-            <p class="noindent1">And yet they&#8217;re more painful than those that do.</p>
-            <p class="noindent1">There are anxieties from dreams that are more real</p>
-            <p class="noindent1">Than the ones life brings; there are sensations</p>
-            <p class="noindent1">Felt only by imagining them</p>
-            <p class="noindent1">That are more ours than our very own life.</p>

-            <p class="noindent1">And lastingly are ours, they&#8217;re us...</p>
-            <p class="noindent1">Over the muddy green of the wide river</p>
-            <p class="noindent1">The white circumflexes of the seagulls...</p>
-            <p class="noindent1">Over my soul the useless flutter</p>
-            <p class="noindent1"><a id="page_7"></a>Of what never was nor could be, and it&#8217;s everything.</p>
-            <p class="noindent2">Give me more wine, because life is nothing.</p>
-            <p class="noindent">(Translation: Richard Zenith. From Fernando Pessoa, <i>A Little Larger Than the Entire Universe</i>, Penguin Books 2006.)</p>
-            <p class="noindent">In the poem several assertions are made; assertions about the texture of existence. The poem states that things are this way and that way. There are sicknesses that are worse than any sickness and therefore are also something <i>other</i> than sickness (although they are, nonetheless, sicknesses), and the anxieties from dreams are more real than those that afflict us in what we call life or reality (which means that the concepts &#8220;dream&#8221; and &#8220;reality&#8221; must be challenged), and so on. Sicknesses, anxieties, a hint of elusive hopes and a significant measure of resignation. If we were to attempt to identify some sort of all-encompassing feature of Pessoa&#8217;s poem, we might perhaps agree that it encapsulates a frame of mind, even an acquired outlook on life. And that this frame of mind and this outlook are coloured by an increasingly lucid sadness.</p>

There are sicknesses that are worse than any sickness and therefore are also something <i>other</i> than sickness (although they are, nonetheless, sicknesses), and the anxieties from dreams are more real than those that afflict us in what we call life or reality (which means that the concepts &#8220;dream&#8221; and &#8220;reality&#8221; must be challenged), and so on.

And that this frame of mind and this outlook are coloured by an increasingly lucid sadness.</p>
             <p class="noindent">But exactly where does this sadness exist? Well, not on the piece of paper or on the screen where the poem is available to us. For there, if we are going to be picky, only a set of abstract, graphic symbols in various combinations exists. That these combinations of something that we call letters come together to produce something we call words, and that moreover these &#8220;words&#8221; mean something and have a context-specific value, depends entirely on a social contract that most of us subscribe to through learning, because it is comforting and in many respects also enriching. We look at the symbols and conjure up various perceptions. Which means that the question of where this sadness actually exists, to the extent that it actually <i>does</i> exist, remains unanswered, unless it exists on the piece of paper or on the screen.</p>
             <p class="noindent"><a id="page_8"></a>And we may take this one step further: Does art exist? Most people do not question that a whole host of physically tangible objects that purport to be art actually exist, although there are many who would energetically deny the unique experience of art that others testify to more or less loquaciously and eloquently. This concept of art actually being an organised hoax, orchestrated for the purpose of enriching all those who participate in this racket while making them appear to be extremely high-minded, is a philistine concept, deeply rooted and difficult to address. Where people do not participate in the social contract they do not quite understand what it is all about, and consequently assume that it must be some sort of fraud. Someone is fooling you and all the others are either pretending that everything is as it should be, or are allowing themselves to be convinced without being able to see through the hoax. This applies, by the way, to a large degree also to philosophy which, outside certain protected reserves, is considered a rather dubious activity. Maybe it does not exist either.</p>
             <p class="noindent">But returning to Pessoa&#8217;s sadness &#8211; where does it exist? For we maintain that it does. And the answer closest at hand is surely that it is we as readers who create it. With the ardent support of the author himself of course. He and we create it together with the aid of that set of social contracts that is literature and poetry, in exactly the same way that we create a multitude of other things that exist in and through language with the aid of various other social contracts: nations, ideologies, communities of various kinds. This in turn means that most of us who are either reading or writing this book, and who now and then reflect on existential and ontological problems, are carrying around a relatively flexible definition of what it actually means that something &#8220;exists&#8221;. There is a lot that does not exist, but that actually does exist &#8211; in language. The sadness of Pessoa, or rather the sadness of the poem, does not exist in the same sense that the saucepan that is standing over there on the kitchen stove exists, <a id="page_9"></a>which we can touch and measure and weigh and photograph, and whose existence is irrefutable since the meat stew inside it would certainly spill onto the stove if the saucepan did not actually exist. But we know nevertheless with great certainty that the sadness of the poem actually does exist and that we ourselves are particularly well equipped to vouch for this very fact, since we have participated in creating it. Thus we also know that there exists, just as Pessoa writes, so much that does not exist, but that <i>does</i> exist &#8211; in fact, that lingers there.</p>

             <p class="noindent">First of all syntheism assumes that time is real in a contingent universe. This makes all predictions extremely uncertain, at least in the long-term, just like within meteorology or ecology. But there is also a built-in paralysis in the faith in some kind of generally positive or predominantly negative development. Whether the expectations tip this way or that way basically does not matter; merely the fact that the expectations tip in any direction whatsoever weakens <i>the will to act.</i> If the driving existentialist principle in syntheist ethics is that <i>truth is an act</i> &#8211; you are everything if you act, you are nothing if you do not act and are content to react &#8211; it has the consequence that if the actor is to maximise his or her opportunities for power and influence, all predictions concerning the future must start from <i>an absolute neutral position</i>. The future is not better or worse in any objective sense: meliorism is fundamentally mendacious, the mythology of doom likewise, <i>the future is merely open</i>, full stop. It is from this prediction-neutral starting point that the syntheist ethical imperatives can be formulated. <i>The impossible is possible &#8211; if you want to be associated with truth: act!</i></p>
             <p class="noindent">Badiou maintains that every universal singularly is open vis-&#224;-vis the future and remains constantly unfinished. It is not concerned with our mortality or general fragility. He sums up universality as <i>the faithful construction of an infinite, generic multiplicity</i> where the multiplicity must be primary since <i>the One</i> is <a id="page_350"></a>merely a verbal illusion (that is, <i>the One is the eternalised fictive par excellence,</i> if we use a syntheological vocabulary). Multiplicity is merely a linguistic singular; any singular outside the irreducible plurality does not exist. Every universality is exceptional, has its origin in a single emergence, is assembled step by step, is the consequence of an existential decision, generates an ethical subject and is based on a becoming in an active truth and not on any specific knowledge. Badiou argues that philosophy obviously comprises the art of analysing, but above all is <i>the art of articulating universalities</i>. The truth event arises, according to him, <i>ex nihilio</i>. To begin with, this event is invisible rather than obviously identifiable where and when it occurs. It is not possible to predict or trace based on the circumstances around the situation where it occurs. Instead the truth event gets its status from <i>the faithful</i> subsequently, and its general acceptance is determined by the strength and perseverance of the faithful, their <i>loyalty</i>. It is quite simply the faithful who must make the event true; it can only get its status as a singularity by means of an <i>aesthetic retrospectivity</i>.</p>
             <p class="noindent">The singularity is defined by the fact that it overthrows the prevailing rules of the game, it begins a new era, it sends out a powerful shock wave through the ethical subject, which is changed so radically that we must speak of a kind of <i>rebirth</i>. Note that <i>the truth event is always internal, it occurs from the inside out</i> rather than from the outside in. It can thus not be forced by some external power that invades the phenomenon in some mysterious way. This means that, for example, military interventions and incoming meteorites are never events in this specific sense. This is where <i>Badiou&#8217;s ethical imperative</i> breaks radically with <i>Kant&#8217;s moral imperative.</i> According to Kant, Man becomes an authentic individual by carrying out his duty. According to Badiou, it is instead a necessity to oppose the external norm, vis-&#224;-vis the accepted duty. <i>According to Badiou, it is this opposition to the norm and not the fulfilment of duty that is the condition for living subjectivity.</i> The singularity is a cultural and not a <a id="page_351"></a>natural phenomenon. Badiou&#8217;s ethical imperative entails that Man becomes <i>an authentic dividual</i> by opposing the prevailing norm and fighting for a new world order with an eye to <i>the syntheist utopia.</i></p>
-            <p class="noindent4">If the truth is an act that generates an event, the genuine event creates a new truth. The truth event is followed by a decision that is followed by a loyalty vis-&#224;-vis the decision about the truth. Aside from this there is no truth beyond the event. Here Badiou breaks radically with Karl Popper&#8217;s obsession with <i>verification</i> as the guarantor of truth. Badiou argues that verifications take decades to construct and that the proponents of truth wisely enough never wait for the verification before they act on the basis of the truth. He thus defends <i>an active truth concept</i> vis-&#224;-vis Popper&#8217;s extremely reactive truth concept. He then divides up the development of the truth event into four phases which we go through, both as dividual truth actors and as an historical collective.</p>
-            <p class="noindent3">1. The revelation of the truth event.</p>
-            <p class="noindent3">2. The denial of the event as the truth.</p>
-            <p class="noindent3">3. The repression of the event as truth.</p>
-            <p class="noindent4">4. The resurrection the truth as the event.</p>
-            <p class="noindent">But what happens to rationalism&#8217;s idea of truth as the correct assertion about existence? Like all other forms of <i>transrationalism</i> from Hegel onwards, syntheism does not deny that such a deepest truth about existence actually exists. But the enormous complexity in such a deepest truth, and the insufficiency of language and thought when it comes to even getting close to it, makes it unattainable.

             <p class="noindent"><a id="page_352"></a>The truth about existence is so deep, so complex, so multifaceted, that it is impossible to reach, since it lies infinitely far from the outermost limit of Man&#8217;s perception and the power of mankind&#8217;s imagination (designed by the process of evolution for functional orientation in our environment, not for revealing the truth), on the other side of the border to <i>psychosis</i>. This means that quite irrespective of whether Man likes it or not, he is forced to outsource the deepest truth to <i>theological mysticism</i>. For what is the concept of God seen at the deepest level, if not the ultimate truth about existence which Man, with his mental limitations, never can reach? We therefore place the deepest truth with <i>Syntheos</i>, the God that we create based on the insight into our mental limitations, and we place it in the open-ended future, while at the same time we generate both scientific and existential truths through our actions. <i>The truth as an act is not just the most important principle within ethics; according to transrationalism it is also the only possible truth within epistemology.</i></p>
             <p class="noindent">To philosophise is to metathink, and what Jacques Lacan calls <i>the real</i> and what Badiou calls <i>the unnamable</i> is philosophy&#8217;s eternal variability, its own built-in impossibility, its genesis that consistently avoids transitioning into a becoming. Here Badiou stubbornly opposes Gilles Deleuze&#8217;s process philosophical foundation: where Deleuze in following Spinoza states that multiplicity is identical with <i>the One</i>, that multiplicity is <i>univocal</i>, Badiou argues that multiplicity is undefinable. He accuses Deleuze of building a lovely constructivism that relies entirely on intuition, while he himself relies only on the stringency of mathematics. Against this Spinozist and Deleuzian <i>multiplicity of the One</i> (Entheos through Pantheos) he posits <i>the multiplicity of emptiness</i> (Entheos through Atheos), an emptiness that is a non non-being. Only in this ontological equation of multiplicity and emptiness does Badiou see the possibility of correctly reflecting the nature of multiplicity. It is only when <i>somebody gets the energy from Atheos to formulate the truth</i> that the truth becomes an event.</p>
             <p class="noindent"><a id="page_353"></a>We return to syntheism as the social theory of everything, and of course it accommodates both the Deleuzian and the Badiouian variants of <i>pathos</i>. Deleuze&#8217;s entheist multiplicity takes its point of departure in <i>Pantheos</i>, while Badiou&#8217;s entheist multiplicity takes its point of departure in <i>Atheos</i>. Deleuze is the pantheological prophet, Badiou is the prophet of atheology, and <i>entheology</i> is the oscillation between these two antipoles; a movement that is completed through the addition of <i>Syntheos</i> to the syntheological pyramid. In the midst of this earth-shattering oscillation, Deleuze and Badiou, the event&#8217;s two prophets above all others, are in agreement that what is most important for the syntheist is the decision to enter at least one of the temples that is devoted to either Pantheos or Atheos and engage in its activities, while the ethically reprehensible thing to do is to remain passively outside. Both these temples are needed as foundations. Both these temples fill us with wonder and produce spiritual truth. Deleuze&#8217;s pantheology moves in the direction of Entheos, Badiou&#8217;s atheology reaches out towards Syntheos. It is pantheology that makes us appreciate the existential intensity of existence, <i>to further develop pantheism into entheism</i>, while it is atheology that drives us to long for the fulfilment of the utopia and which makes us <i>consummate atheism via its deepening in syntheism.</i></p>
